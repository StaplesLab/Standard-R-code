# Standard-R-code
<p>Standard and reproducible R code from the <b>Staples Lab, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia</b>, Canada.</p>
<p>The codes in this folder are standard codes used in various studies to read in linked administrative health datasets (e.g., DAD, MSP, PharmaNet, Vital Statistics, Census, NACRS) from the province of British Columbia in Canada.</p>
<p>The research team at Staples Lab work collaboratively to develop code under the supervision of Dr John A Staples.</p>
<p>Most codes were adapted from initial code written by S Erdelyi and/or JA Staples, which were then adapted 
and modified by D Daly-Grafstein, Y Yu, M Khan and X Hu for various different studies. Updated versions of codes
are then used in subsequent projects by all Staples Lab members.</p>
